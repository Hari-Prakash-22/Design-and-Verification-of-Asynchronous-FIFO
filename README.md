# Design-and-Verification-of-Asynchronous-FIFO
Designed and Verified the Behaviour of the Asynchronous FIFO manage data transfer between two clock domains operating at different frequencies. The design involved an 8-bit wide FIFO with a depth of 16, supporting independent read and write operations on separate clocks. I implemented key features such as full and empty flags to prevent overflows and underflows, ensuring reliable data transfer without loss or corruption.
